# RetroSharp

A parser in C#/.NET which parses out Retrosheet data

## Introduction

[Retrosheet](https://retrosheet.org) is a fan-operated collection of baseball events, personelle, teams, franchises, and ballparks. Retrosheet has been compiling baseball data even into the sport's early days. However, the data files are in CSV format or a slight derivation of CSV. This makes data analysis difficult due to the simple format.

RetroSharp is a tool to help parse [Retrosheet](https://retrosheet.org) data into a RDBMS for ease of data analysis, storage, and presentation.

## Supported RDBMS

1. SQL Server
2. TBD
